15 min:
    average:
        temperature(2)
    sum:
        AC energy (2)
        Various Electronics Energy (2)
        Water Consumption (1)
Day:
    max:
        Etot
        Wtot
???:
    count:
        movement sensor
        
Probably internal aggregations:
    -Diff between days for DAY sensors
    -Diff for power leakage
    -Diff for water leakage

Probably need 3 topics for device->live streaming (min15, dayToMax, movementSensor)
This allows for better load balancing since eg we can allocate more partitions to 15min sensors which have more traffic than daily

15 min:
    average:
        temperature(2)
    sum:
        AC energy (2)
        Various Electronics Energy (2)
        Water Consumption (1)
Day:
    max:
        Etot
        Wtot

    count:
        movement sensor
        
Probably internal aggregations:
    -Diff between days for DAY sensors
    -Diff for power leakage
    -Diff for water leakage

Probably need 3 topics for device->live streaming (min15, day, movementSensor)
This allows for better load balancing since eg we can allocate more partitions to 15min sensors which have more traffic than daily

Topics for live streaming -> data storage:
raw: raw data
aggDay15min: averages and sum
?aggDayDaily: max of each day
aggDayDiff: difference between 2 consecutive dates
leaks: energy and water leaks
totalMovements: count of movement movement detections
lateRejected: late rejected events
